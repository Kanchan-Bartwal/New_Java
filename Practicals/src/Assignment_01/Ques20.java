 * What happens if we add final keyword with Class, Method and a variable in java. Explain it through suitable code if required.
 * Ans. If we add final keyword ina a class then it mens that  there will be no class inheriting this class.
 * No class can inherit the contents of this class.
 * The main purpose of using a class being declared as final is to prevent the class from being used.
 *  -If a class is marked as final then no class can inherit any feature from final class.
 *  -you cannot extend a final class.If you try it gives you a compile time error.
